<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A book</span> in the writer's possession, entitled
"Camp Cookery," contains the following recipe:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Boiled Green Corn.</span>&mdash;Boil twenty-five minutes,
if very young and tender. As it grows older it
requires a longer time. Send to the table in a napkin."</p>

<p>The writer of the above is a good housewife. She
cannot conceive that anybody will attempt to boil
green corn who does not know such rudiments of the
culinary art as the proper quantity of water to put
into the pot and the necessity of its being slightly
salted and at a boil when the corn is put in, instead of
fresh and cold; and, like the careful cook that she is,
she tells the camper to send the ears to the camp
"table" in a "napkin."</p>

<p>The faults of the above recipe are the faults of all
recipes furnished by the majority of books on out-door
life. They do not instruct in those rudimentary
principles of cooking so important to the outer who
has eaten all his life no food except that furnished
him ready for instant despatch; and they commend
to the camper dishes that require materials and
utensils for their preparation which are seldom at
hand in the field and forest.</p>

<p>The object of this little volume is to give to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Corinthian cruiser and the camper some practical
recipes for simple but substantial dishes, in such a
manner that the veriest novice in the art of the
kitchen may prepare palatable food with no more
materials and paraphernalia than are consistent with
light cruising and comfortable camping. The first
part, "Canoe Cookery," instructs in such dishes as
the limited outfit of the canoeist or camper who
"packs" his dunnage afoot will admit of, while
the second part, "Camp Cookery," deals with the
more elaborate <i>menu</i> that can be prepared when ease
of transportation will allow the carriage of a more
extensive supply.</p>

<p>Few of the recipes given are original with the compiler.
Some have been obtained from trappers and
hunters, others from army and navy cooks, and a few
from cook books; but all have been practically
tested in camp or on a cruise by the writer, whose
pleasure in out-door cooking is only equalled by his
delight in out-door life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> canoe cruising a certain amount of food supplies
and the necessary utensils for cooking should
be carried in a single box or chest, so that when one
cooks a meal on board he may have in one receptacle
everything necessary for preparing a meal, and when
going ashore for his repast he can take in his hands
everything requisite at one journey. If on a long
cruise the large portion of his food supply may be
kept in different parts of the canoe, but the box
should contain sufficient for at least three meals, and
can be replenished from the larger store when stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for the night or at a camping place for any
length of time. The larger the box that his stowage
room will allow the greater will be the comfort of the
canoeist.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i011.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The box may be made of wood, tin or galvanized
iron. The former costs but little, can be made by the
cruiser himself, and if properly made and properly
taken care of, should answer the purpose; but a box
of either japanned or painted tin or galvanized iron
will stand much knocking about without fracture, and
is therefore preferable when its expense is no objection.
Of course it must be water-tight, and if made
of wood the nicest joining and dove-tailing must be
done, and it should be varnished inside and out with
shellac or boat varnish. Arbitrary dimensions cannot
be given because of the varying sizes of canoes and
the different amounts of provisions carried on cruises,
therefore let each canoeist first determine what
amount and variety of eatables he will carry, and
then construct the box according to his needs and his
stowage room in the cockpit. If made of wood quarter
inch or 5/16 stuff (pine) will do, and if the box is to
be used as a seat the top and bottom pieces should be
heavier, say 3/8 of an inch. The cover should be two
inches deep and the handle by which the box is carried
should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the cover.
If the box is not used as a seat but is stowed under
the deck it will be found an advantage to have the
flanges of the cover fall over the side pieces of the
box and the strap tacked to one end piece, carried over
the cover and fastened by a hook to an eye in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
other end piece in reach of the hand, so that the cover
may be removed and articles obtained from the box
without taking it from under the deck. If used as a
seat the cover may be hinged on one side and two
hooks fastened at the ends on the other, and for the
back rest two pieces of three-quarter inch pine are
screwed to the sides, running aft horizontally six
or eight inches from the aftermost end of the box, holes
being bored in them an inch apart "athwartship" and
cut opposite each other,
through which a quarter-inch
brass rod is passed for
the back rest to play on.
As the lower end of the
back rest strikes the end of
the box near the floor when
in use, it may be "slanted"
as inclination demands by changing the brass rod
from one set of holes to another.</p>

<p>To carry the provisions in the box so that they will
not mix or spill, several water-tight tins should be
used. The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company, 49
Warren Street, New York, makes tin screw-tops for
jars and canisters that are perfectly water-tight. Send
for several of these tops, of assorted sizes, and have a
tinsmith make the tin cans of the dimensions you
desire, so that they will nest in the box closely. The
same company will also furnish you with a pint or
quart earthen jar with water-tight screw-top, in which
butter may be kept sweet for a long time in hot
weather, and which may be enveloped in a net and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
lowered to the bottom of the river or lake without fear
of its leaking.</p>

<p>In the tin cans may be carried coffee, tea (or cocoa),
sugar, flour (or meal), rice and alcohol. (A special
screw-top is made for fluid cans.) Pepper and salt
are in small spice boxes with two covers, the one
underneath being perforated. Eggs are safest carried
in the tins with the flour, coffee and rice; bread and
bacon (or salt pork) are wrapped in macintosh and
put near the top of the chest; the vinegar goes in a
whisky flask (mark it to avoid mistakes), and canned
goods, condensed milk, baking powder, etc., in their
own cans. The alcohol stove and utensils necessary
to cook a meal should go in the box, such as coffee pot,
cup, fork, knife, spoon, frying pan and plates.
The coffee pot should be of small size, with handle
and lip riveted. If soldered, they are likely to melt
off. Cups or plates should be of tin or granite ware.
The fork and knife have their sheaths of leather
inside the box cover. The plates should nest in the
frying pan, which should have no handle, and is
fastened inside the chest cover by two buttons, so
that it may be readily released. Next the knife and
fork have a sheath for a pair of small blacksmith's
pliers. This instrument serves as a handle to the
frying pan and a lifter for everything on the fire, and
can always be kept cool. A three-quart tin or granite
ware pail is necessary for stews, and two smaller ones
may be nested in it, of two-quart and three-pint
capacity, respectively. Put the can of condensed
milk in the smallest pail. It will be out of the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and won't make the rest of the things in the chest
sticky. If you carry potatoes, onions or other vegetables,
always have enough in the chest for three
meals. The surplus supplies of provisions, such as
vegetables, extra bread, crackers, flour, meal, pork or
bacon, etc., should be carried in waterproof bags, and
they can then be stowed wherever necessary to
properly trim the canoe. These waterproof bags
may be used also for clothing and blankets. They
are made of unbleached muslin, sewn in a lap seam,
with a double row of stitches. When sewn they are
dipped in water and slightly shaken to remove the
drops, and then while wet a mixture of equal parts of
boiled oil, raw oil and turpentine is applied to the
outside with a brush. This takes about a week to
become thoroughly dry, and then another coat is put
on without dampening the cloth, and if a little liquid
drier is added to the mixture, this coat will dry in
four or five days. Having prepared several bags, the
provisions, clothing, blankets, etc., are put in the bag,
and its mouth is inserted in that of another bag of the
same size, the latter being drawn on like a stocking as
far as it will go. If several bags are used instead of
one or two large ones, the canoe can be trimmed and
packed to better advantage.</p>

<p>A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small
basins, one of which has "ears" riveted to its rim, so
that when it is placed bottom up on the other the ears
will spring over the rim of the second basin, thus
making an oven that is not air-tight, allowing gases to
escape. The basins should be made of sheet-iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and, as their interiors can easily be kept clean, they
answer very well for soup dishes. Instructions for
baking in them will be given later on. These should
not go in the provision chest, as they will smut everything
with which they come in contact. Butter, I
have found, keeps better in its jar outside of the
chest than in. Outside, too, are kept a small jug of
molasses, and a jug of fresh water, if cruising on the
"briny."</p>

<p>There is no perfect canoe stove. The "flamme
forcé" is probably as good as any. It takes up a
little more room than the folding "pocket" variety,
and it does not give more heat; but it burns for a
longer time, and is not top-heavy when a heavy pot or
pan is set on it. For cooking in large utensils have three
of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and
place them side by side, and you can cook in this way
a dozen slapjacks at once on a big griddle, if you like.
Danforth, the fluid man, makes a small canoe stove
that would be preferable to all others if his fluid were
obtainable at all the corners of the earth that canoeists
frequent; but unfortunately it is not. Beware of
"folding stoves" to use ashore and burn wood in.
They are the greatest possible nuisances&mdash;smutty,
red-hot and cumbersome. Don't carry an oil stove.
But if you really must, put the nasty thing in a large
bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Now as to eatables in general, besides what I have
already mentioned, condensed milk is a good thing,
but condensed coffee, condensed eggs and condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
beef are abominations. Self-raising or Hecker's prepared
flour, wheat, rye, Indian or Graham, is easily
made into bread and slapjacks. The directions come
with the packages. Pilot bread will keep an indefinite
time, and is not so unpalatable as hard-tack. Indian
meal is very nutritious and easily made up, as it
requires nothing to lighten it; scald it before using
when it is not fresh. Canned tomatoes, corn, fruits,
beans, soups, salmon, etc., are easy to prepare, and
can be stored as ballast in the canoe. Mr. Hicks, of
the Toronto Canoe Club, prepares certain kinds of
food in cans for ballast as follows, according to the
<i>American Canoeist</i>:</p>

<p>"Get a number of flat square tin cans made like
oyster cans, of a handy size to lie under your floor
boards. Then cook a turkey, some chickens, a sirloin
of beef, etc. Cut the hot meat up into large dice-shaped
pieces, and put it in the tins hot, then pour
melted fat in till the tins are full, and then solder
them tight. Get as much meat in as you can before
putting in the fat. Put up fruit in square flat cans in
the same way. There is your ballast, and heavy stuff
it is. When the provisions run short let the crew feed
on the ballast. The preparation described is far
more nutritious than canned corned beef, is more
palatable, and will keep indefinitely&mdash;that is, throughout
a very long cruise."</p>

<p>I have not tried this method of preserving provisions,
but the theory is excellent, and I do not see why
it would not be a feasible scheme. The Brunswick
canned soups are the cheapest made, are easily prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and as wholesome as any; but I have known
squeamish canoeists who would not use them because
they didn't like the looks of the powder to which they
are desiccated. Dried beef, corned beef, lemons and
sardines make good additions to an outfit. Potatoes,
onions and other vegetables should be procured en
route as needed, if possible.</p>

<p>As it may puzzle some neophytes to know how much
of each article of food to take on a cruise, I give below
the exact amount of provisions I carried on a
cruise of a week last autumn. I did not run short of
anything at the end of the week, but I had not provisions
enough left for three square meals: 1 lb. sugar
(cut loaf); 1/8 lb. tea; 1 lb. flour; 1-1/2 lbs. crackers;
1/2 lb. lard; 1/2 lb. rice; 1/2 lb. bacon; 3/4 lb. coffee;
1 lb. butter; 1 can condensed milk; 3 loaves bread;
3/4 peck potatoes; 1/2 peck meal; 1 pint molasses; 2
oz. pepper; 1 bottle pickles; 1 bottle yeast powder;
1 qt. salt.</p>

Wholesome, and Convenient.&mdash;Huckins' Soups.&mdash;Oyster,
Clam, Onion, and Tomato Soups.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Canoeists</span> will hardly take the time and trouble to
make soups out of meats and vegetables, unless
they are in a permanent camping place for some length
of time. Nearly all soups require several hours to cook
properly, as they must be boiled very slowly to retain
the aroma of the ingredients used.</p>

<p>Canned soups, therefore, are the handiest for the
canoeist or single-hand cruiser. I can recommend the
Brunswick variety as cheap, convenient, wholesome
and easy to prepare if the directions on the cans are
implicitly followed. Any variation from these instructions,
however, is certain to result in an unpalatable
mess. The higher priced soups, Huckins' and other
varieties, are more like home-made soups than the
Brunswick kind, and hence a fastidious taste will prefer
them. They are bulkier to carry, but are quite as
easily prepared, and I would recommend those made
by Huckins as especially good. The great objection
to them is their high price.</p>

<p>There are a few good soups that can be prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
from materials readily accessible to the canoeist, and
in a comparatively short time. These are:</p>


<h4>Oyster Soup.</h4>

<p>Put a quart of milk and a piece of butter as large as
an egg into the pot and heat gradually. When hot,
stir in the strained liquor of one pint of oysters, very
gradually, to prevent the milk from curdling, then one-quarter
pound of crushed crackers or bread
crumbs. When it has come to a boil put in the oysters
(one pint), and let it cook till the edges of the oysters
curl up, when it should be seasoned and served.</p>


<h4>Clam Soup.</h4>

<p>Exactly the same as oyster soup, using clams instead
of oysters.</p>


<h4>Onion Soup.</h4>

<p>Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying pan,
cut six large onions in slices, and stir them into the
butter over the fire till they begin to cook. Then
cover tight and set them where they will simmer
slowly for half an hour. Put a quart of milk with a
tablespoonful of butter on to boil, and while this is
doing stir into the onions a tablespoonful of flour while
they are simmering. Turn the mixture into the boiling
milk and cook quarter of an hour, seasoning with
salt and pepper. If an old tin pan is handy that you
can use for the purpose, the soup will be improved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
knocking small holes in the bottom of the pan, thus
making a colander, and straining the soup through it,
afterwards adding the well-beaten yolks of four eggs
and cooking three minutes longer.</p>


<h4>Tomato Soup.</h4>

<p>Mix one tablespoonful of flour and a piece of butter
the size of an egg into a smooth paste, and if you have
onions, chop up fine one medium-sized one. Prepare
about one pound of tomatoes by scalding, peeling and
slicing them (the same amount of canned tomatoes may
be used), and put all the ingredients with a pinch of
salt into one pint of cold water. Boil gently for an
hour, stirring frequently enough to dissolve the tomatoes
and prevent burning, then stir in one cup of
boiled milk, and let it come again to a boil, constantly
stirring. Season and serve. The soup will be good
if the milk is omitted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Fish.&mdash;Fish Caught in Muddy Streams.&mdash;Kill your Fish
as Soon as Caught.&mdash;Fish Grubs.&mdash;Fish Fried,
Planked, Skewered, and Boiled.&mdash;Fish Sauce, Fish
Roe, Shell-Fish.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Fish</span> should naturally have a prominent place in
the canoeist's larder. Few streams that he will
navigate are entirely destitute of edible fish, and a
few minutes spent in angling will amply repay the
cruiser.</p>

<p>Fish caught out of muddy streams have an unpleasant
taste, and their flavor can be improved by soaking
them half an hour or more in strong salted water.
Fish should be killed as soon as caught by a sharp
rap on the back just aft of the head with a stick or
the handle of your big knife, not only in justice to the
fish, but because he tastes better, for the same reason
that a butchered steer is preferable to one smothered
to death.</p>

<p>You may find grubs in fish along the backbone in
July and August. You will generally remove them
by taking out the backbone and its branches. But if
you don't get them all out, never mind; they are good
to eat; but if any one of the party is squeamish, tell
him you have got them all out anyway: he won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
know any better after they are cooked. It is supposed
that everybody has known how to clean fish ever since
he was a schoolboy, so we will proceed at once to the
instructions for cooking.</p>


<h4>Fried Fish.</h4>

<p>Small fish may be fried whole, but large ones should
be cut up. Have enough pork fat or lard bubbling
hot in the frying-pan to well cover the fish. Smear
the fish well with dry corn meal or flour, or, what is
better, dip it into well-beaten egg and then into bread
or cracker crumbs, and fry both sides to a clear
golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt
just as it is turning brown.</p>


<h4>Planked Fish.</h4>

<p>Shad, flounders, sunfish or any other "flat" fish
may be "planked." Cut off the head and tail, split
open the back, but do not cut clear through the belly,
leaving the fish so that it may be opened wide like a
book and tacked on a plank or piece of bark. Tack
some thin slices of bacon or pork to the end of the
fish that will be uppermost when before the fire, and,
if you like, a few slices of raw onion sprinkled with
pepper and salt. Sharpen one end of the plank and
drive it into the ground, before a bed of hot coals.
Catch the drippings in a tin cup or large spoon and
baste the fish continually till it smells so good you
can't wait another instant to eat it. It is then done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<h4>Skewered Trout.</h4>

<p>Sharpen a small, straight stick, and on it skewer
small trout and thin slices of bacon or pork in alternation.
Hold over a bed of hot coals and keep constantly
turning, so that the juices will not be lost in the
fire. A very few minutes will suffice to cook the trout.</p>


<h4>Boiled Fish.</h4>

<p>Tie or pin the fish (which should not weigh less
than three pounds) in a clean cloth. If the pot is too
small for the fish, skewer the tail into the mouth.
Put into enough boiling water to cover it about an
inch, and simmer steadily until done. Some fish boil
quicker than others; as a general rule those of white
flesh requiring less time than those of a darker tinge.
If a couple of tablespoonfuls of salt and four ditto of
vinegar are put into the water the fish will cook sooner.
About twenty-five minutes are necessary for a three-pound
fish, and over that six minutes extra to every
pound. An underdone fish is not fit to eat, and one
boiled too long is insipid. When the meat separates
easily from the backbone it is cooked just right. Take
it up, remove the cloth carefully, and pour over it the
following hot</p>


<h4>Fish Sauce.</h4>

<p>Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two ditto of
flour into a hot frying pan over the fire and mix them
together with a spoon into a smooth paste. Pour
over very gradually about a pint of the water in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the fish was boiled, stirring it well in. Boil up once
and season with pepper and salt. If an acid taste is
desired, add a few drops of vinegar.</p>


<h4>Boiled Fish Roe.</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe the roes with a soft cloth. Wrap in
a cloth and boil the same as fish. Or, they may be
tied inside the fish with a string and boiled with it.</p>


<h4>Fried Fish Roe.</h4>

<p>Prepare as above, dredge in meal or flour, and fry
exactly as fish.</p>


<h4>Soft Crabs.</h4>

<p>Have enough boiling hot grease in a pan over a
hot fire to cover the crabs. Throw them in as soon
as possible after they are taken, with a little salt. Let
them brown and turn them once. When done cut off
the gills or "dead men's fingers," and serve on toast.</p>


<h4>Hard Shell Crabs.</h4>

<p>These are best steamed. Boil two cups of water in
your largest pail. Put in two or three large handfuls
of grass and then the crabs, as soon as possible after
they are caught. Over them put more grass, and,
covering the pail, let them steam thoroughly over the
fire for twenty minutes. When done, eat all except
the shell, the gills and the stomach, which last is in an
easily distinguished sack. Be sure to have sufficient
water in the pail to keep up the steam for the requisite
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h4>Fried Oysters.</h4>

<p>Strain the liquor from the oysters. Crush crackers
into fine crumbs; or, if you have no crackers, toast
some slices of bread and crush them fine. Beat up
an egg (both white and yolk) in a tin cup with a
spoon. Dip the oysters into the beaten egg, then
roll them in the crumbs, and put over the fire in a
pan of boiling fat over half an inch deep. Turn when
brown on one side, and let the other side brown. If
the oysters are small do not prepare them singly, but
place them two together (the large portions at opposite
ends), then immerse them in the egg and crumbs
together. If the crumbs do not readily adhere, pat
the oysters gently while rolling them in the crumbs.</p>


<h4>Blanketed Oysters.</h4>

<p>Get the largest oysters you can find, cut fat bacon
into very thin slices, wrap an oyster in each slice, and
skewer with a small stick. Heat a frying pan very
hot, put in your oysters, and cook long enough to just
crisp the bacon&mdash;not over two minutes&mdash;taking care
that they do not burn. Serve immediately without
removing the skewers.</p>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Meats and Game.&mdash;Salt Pork.&mdash;Ham and Eggs.&mdash;Broiling
and Boiling Meats.&mdash;Pigeons, Squirrels, Ducks, Grouse,
Woodcock, Rabbits, Frogs, etc.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> selecting salt pork pick out that which is smooth
and dry. Damp, clammy pork is unwholesome.
Canned corn beef is palatable, and useful in making
hash, but is sometimes poisonous from the solder used
in sealing the cans. If canned beef is carried, use
only the portion that does not touch the metal of the
cans, throwing away the remainder.</p>


<h4>Fried Salt Pork (or Bacon).</h4>

<p>Slice thin, put in frying pan with cold water enough
to cover, let it come to a boil and boil two or three
minutes; then turn off the water and fry brown on
both sides; or, soak one hour in cold water, then roll
in bread or cracker crumbs and fry with a little butter
or lard in the pan.</p>


<h4>Broiled Salt Pork.</h4>

<p>Slice thin, and broil on the end of a green switch
held over the coals, using extra care that the smoke
and flame from the drippings do not reach the pork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<h4>Ham and Eggs.</h4>

<p>Fry the ham first, the same as pork or bacon, and
fry the eggs in the fat left in the pan. Break each
egg separately into a cup, and thence transfer it to
the pan, by which means the yolks are kept intact and
bad eggs are discovered before it is too late. While
the eggs are frying dip up some of the fat with a
spoon and pour it over the tops of the eggs.</p>


<h4>Broiled Steaks.</h4>

<p>If the steak is tough, beat it on both sides, but not
enough to tear the meat and allow the juices to escape.
Sharpen a green switch at the end, secure the steak on
it, and place over a bed of hot coals, turning frequently.
Do not let the escaping juices set fire to the
meat. Season, after it is done, with pepper and salt,
and if a gravy is desired, put a half teaspoonful of
salt, half as much pepper, and a piece of butter or fat
as large as a duck's egg into a hot dish, and add two
tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Pour it over the
steak slowly, so that every part of the latter will be
moistened.</p>


<h4>Broiling in a Frying Pan.</h4>

<p>Broiling can be done as well with a frying pan as
with a gridiron, and all the juices are preserved.
Heat the empty pan very hot first, then put in the
meat to be broiled, cover over with a tin plate, and
turn the meat often in the pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>


<h4>Boiled Meat.</h4>

<p>Put the meat into enough boiling water so that the
former will be a little more than covered. Cover the
pot and boil till cooked, which will take about fifteen
minutes for every pound of meat. Skim constantly
while boiling, and turn the meat several times. Replenish
when necessary with boiling water. One
teaspoonful of salt for each five pounds of meat
should be put into the pot a short time before the
meat is done. If there is a layer of fat on top after
the meat is cold, remove it. Beef or venison may be
used for frying.</p>


<h4>Fried Pigeons.</h4>

<p>Dress them, parboil until they are tender, then cut
off the legs and wings, slice off the breast pieces, roll
in flour or meal and fry in hot pork fat till they are
nicely browned. Grouse, ducks, quail, snipe and
plover may also be fried, but are better cooked as
given below. Snipe, quail and plover need no
parboiling.</p>


<h4>Fried Squirrels.</h4>

<p>Skin and clean, cutting off heads, tails and feet.
Parboil and fry, same as pigeons.</p>


<h4>Roast Quail, Snipe or Plover.</h4>

<p>Dress and impale each on a stick with a piece of
fat pork in each bird. Set the stick in the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
before a big bed of live coals in a slanting position so
that the heat will fall evenly on all portions of the
bird, and turn frequently till a sharp sliver will easily
pass through the breast. Catch the drippings in a
tin cup and pour over the birds again and again, and
if they are served on toast pour the drippings also on
the toast. The blacksmith's pliers mentioned in Chapter
I. will come in handy for turning the birds before
the fire on their sticks and holding the cup to catch
the drippings. Without this tool the cook's hands are
likely to be roasted by the time the birds are done.</p>


<h4>Roast Ducks and Grouse.</h4>

<p>Parboil till tender, then roast as above.</p>


<h4>Roast Woodcock.</h4>

<p>Pick, but do not clean. Roast as above without
parboiling. Remove the entrails after the bird is
done.</p>


<h4>Rabbits or Hares.</h4>

<p>These require considerable parboiling unless young.
They may be fried like squirrels, cutting them into
pieces, or made into stews.</p>


<h4>Stewed Rabbit.</h4>

<p>After skinning and cleaning the rabbit cut it into
pieces, and wash again in cold water. Mince an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
onion, cleanse and cut into small pieces one-half
pound of fat salt pork, and put with the cut-up rabbit
into a pot with about a pint of cold water. Season
with pepper and salt, cover the pot and let it simmer
till the flesh can be easily pierced with a sharp sliver.
Take it up when done and set where it will keep warm,
and make a gravy by adding to the water left in the
pot one cup of boiling milk or water, stirring in gradually
one well-beaten egg and one or two tablespoonfuls
of flour made into a smooth paste with cold water.
Boil one minute and then pour over the rabbit. This
gravy will be nearly or quite as good if the egg is
omitted.</p>


<h4>Stewed Ducks or Pigeons.</h4>

<p>Stew exactly the same as rabbits. The pork may
be omitted without detracting from the edible quality
of the dish.</p>


<h4>Frogs.</h4>

<p>Use only the hind legs of small frogs, but both the
fore and hind legs of large ones. They are best
broiled, but may be fried in butter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Vegetables.&mdash;Potatoes and Green Corn, Boiled, Fried,
Roasted and Stewed.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> canoeist, whose stowage room is limited, will
not carry with him a variety of vegetables, therefore
completer directions for cooking these edibles will be
left for Part II. of this book, and instructions will here
be given only for the preparation of the potatoes,
which he will most certainly carry, and green corn,
which, in its season, he can obtain readily, if his cruise
leads him through a farming country. These two
articles will form the canoeist's mainstay in the vegetable
line, and can be prepared in several appetizing
ways.</p>


<h4>Boiled Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Small or medium-sized potatoes are preferable to
large ones. Choose those with small eyes, as those
with large eyes are generally about to sprout and are
of poor quality. Do not pare unless they are very
old, and in the latter case put them in cold water and
allow it to boil. If they are of unequal size cut the
large ones, so that they will boil evenly; wash, cut out
bad places and eyes, and slice off a piece of skin at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
each pointed end. Put, unless old, into enough boiling
salted water to cover them, and simmer steadily
till a sliver will easily pierce the largest. Strain when
done, and set the pot near the fire, shaking them occasionally
to dry them.</p>


<h4>Mashed Potatoes.</h4>

<p>After boiling, peel and mash thoroughly with the
bottom of a large bottle, working in pepper, salt, butter,
and sufficient hot milk or water to make them into
the consistency of soft dough. If mashed in an iron
pot they will be discolored, but will taste just as good
as if mashed in tin or earthenware.</p>


<h4>Roasted Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe them dry, and cut off the ends.
Bury them in the ashes till a sliver will easily pierce
them. Do not make the common mistake of putting
them among the live coals of the fire, or they will
be burned, not cooked through.</p>


<h4>Fried Cooked Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Peel and slice cold cooked potatoes, and put them
into enough "screeching hot" lard or pork fat to
cover the bottom of the pan. Stir frequently and fry
slowly, seasoning with pepper and salt.</p>


<h4>Fried Raw Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Wash, peel, and slice very thin. Put few at a time
into enough boiling fat to float the slices. If too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
are put in at one time they will chill the fat and will
not fry evenly. Turn and fry a light brown on both
sides. When done remove with a fork, leaving as
much grease as possible, and shake them up in a
covered dish to eliminate the grease still further.</p>


<h4>Stewed Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes into pieces the size of a
hickory nut, put them into enough boiling milk to
cover them, and let them simmer slowly till the milk is
nearly exhausted, stirring frequently to prevent burning.
Season with pepper, salt and butter.</p>


<h4>Sweet Potatoes.</h4>

<p>Are cooked the same as Irish potatoes, but require
longer time. See time table in Part II.</p>


<h4>Boiled Green Corn.</h4>

<p>The sweetness of corn is better preserved in the
boiling if the outer layer of husks only is stripped off.
Turn back the inner husks and strip off the silk, then
replace the inner husks and tie the ends. Put the
corn into enough boiling salt water to cover it. Boil,
if young, twenty-five minutes; if old, nearly or quite
twice as long. After half an hour's boiling, an ear
had best be removed occasionally and the kernels
prodded with a sliver, to see if they have cooked
tender. Overboiling spoils corn. Drain off the water
as soon as they are done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<h4>Fried Corn.</h4>

<p>Cut cold boiled corn from the cob, mix with mashed
potatoes, and fry in butter or pork fat.</p>


<h4>Roasted Corn.</h4>

<p>Leave the ear in the husks, cover it well with the
hot ashes, and let it remain from forty-five minutes to
an hour.</p>


<h4>Stewed Corn.</h4>

<p>Cut the corn from the cob, put it into a pot, barely
covering it with cold milk. Season it with pepper and
salt, and if common field corn, with sugar. Cover
and stew gently till very tender.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Coffee and Tea.&mdash;Mush, Johnnycake and Hoecake.&mdash;Slapjacks,
Corn Dodgers, Ash Cakes, Biscuits, Camp Bread.&mdash;Eggs.</span></p></blockquote>


<h4>Coffee.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> simplest way to make good coffee is to put into
the pot two tablespoonfuls of the ground and
browned berry to each cupful of the beverage. Pour on
cold water to the required amount, remove it from the
fire when it first boils up, let it stand a few moments in a
warm place, and then pour into the pot half a cup of
cold water to settle it.</p>


<h4>Coffee, No. 2.</h4>

<p>If the ground coffee is running low or the cook
wishes to economize and has plenty of time and utensils,
I will give him a recipe which requires much less
of the berry to produce the required strength, as follows:
Put the dry coffee into the pot, and heat it,
stirring it constantly. Then pour over it one quart of
boiling water to every two tablespoonfuls of coffee,
and set the pot where it will keep hot but not boil.
After standing ten or fifteen minutes it is ready to
drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<h4>Tea.</h4>

<p>For most teas the right proportion is one tablespoonful
of tea for every teacup that is to be drawn and one
"for the pot." The simplest method of making it is
to put cold water on the tea in the pot, set over the
fire and let it almost boil. Just as it begins to steam
remove it to a place less hot, where it will simmer and
not boil for five minutes. If it boils or simmers too
long the tannin will be dissolved, and the tea will have
a disagreeable astringent taste. When the liquid is
all used out of the pot I do not throw away the
"grounds," but add one-half the quantity for the next
drawing, and so on till the pot is one-third full of
grounds, when it is all emptied and the pot thoroughly
washed.</p>


<h4>Cornmeal Mush.</h4>

<p>The main difficulties in making good cornmeal
mush are the care necessary to prevent the formation
of lumps and the long time required to cook it. The
surest way to avoid lumps is to mix the meal first with
cold water enough to make a thin batter, and then
pour this batter into the pot of boiling water (slightly
salted) very gradually, so as not to stop the boiling
process. Sufficient of the batter should be stirred in
to make a thin mush, and the latter should then be
boiled until it is of such consistency that it will hang
well together when taken out with a spoon. The
longer it is allowed to boil the better it will be, and if
long boiling makes it too thick, add more boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
water. It can be advantageously boiled two hours,
but is eatable after twenty minutes' boil. If it is
sprinkled into the pot of boiling water dry, do so very
gradually and stir it constantly to prevent its lumping.</p>


<h4>Fried Cold Mush.</h4>

<p>Cut cold cornmeal mush into slices half an inch
thick, and fry on both sides in boiling pork fat or
butter. Or, dip each slice into beaten egg (salted),
then into bread or cracker crumbs, and fry. If fried
in lard add a little salt.</p>


<h4>Oatmeal Mush.</h4>

<p>Is made the same as cornmeal mush, but must always
be sprinkled dry into the pot of boiling water.</p>


<h4>Johnnycake.</h4>

<p>Make a thick batter by mixing warm (not scalding)
water or milk with one pint of cornmeal, and mix in
with this a small teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful
of melted lard. Grease your bake-tins (described
in Chapter I.) thoroughly with lard or butter, set the
Johnnycake batter in one, cover over with the other,
and bury the oven amongst the hot coals and ashes of
the camp-fire, heaping the coals around it so as to have
an equal heat on all portions of the oven. In twenty
minutes dig out the oven, open it with the pliers and
test the Johnnycake. It should be thoroughly baked
in a good fire in from twenty to thirty minutes. If
the meal is mixed with scalding water it will be lumpy
and difficult to work into a batter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>


<h4>Hoe Cakes.</h4>

<p>Johnnycake batter, thinned down with more warm
water or milk, may be fried the same as slapjacks.</p>


<h4>Slapjacks.</h4>

<p>To properly cook slapjacks the frying pan should
be perfectly clean and smooth inside. If it is not, too
much grease is required in cooking. Scrape it after
each panful is cooked, and then only occasional greasing
will be required, and this is best done with a clean
rag containing butter. Drop thin batter in with a
spoon, so that the cake will be very thin. Disturb it
as little as possible, and when the cake is cooked firm
on one side, turn it and cook on the other.</p>


<h4>Cornmeal Slapjacks.</h4>

<p>One quart of cold water is mixed with meal enough
to make a thin batter, one teaspoonful of salt and one
or two teaspoonfuls of baking powder having been
stirred into the latter. The addition of one or two
well-beaten eggs will improve it. Cook on a very hot
pan, as above.</p>


<h4>Wheat Slapjacks.</h4>

<p>Make as above, except using wheat flour, and adding
last of all one heaping tablespoonful of melted
lard or butter, thoroughly stirred in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>


<h4>Hecker's Flour Slapjacks.</h4>

<p>Mix well one pint of Hecker's prepared flour with
one-half pint of cold milk or water. Cook as above.</p>


<h4>Corn Dodgers.</h4>

<p>Mix one pint of corn meal, one small teaspoonful
of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar with warm (not
scalding) water enough to make a moderately stiff
batter. Make into flat cakes about three-quarters of
an inch thick, and fry in <i>boiling</i> fat till brown. Fried
in bacon fat and eaten with the fried bacon they are
very palatable.</p>


<h4>Corn Pone or Ash Cakes.</h4>

<p>If unprovided with the portable oven or bake tin
recommended in Chapter I., mix up a pint of corn
meal with water and a pinch of salt into a stiff dough,
make into cakes, and set them on a clean, hot stone
close to the coals of a hot fire. When the outside of
the cakes has hardened a little cover them completely
in hot ashes. In fifteen to twenty-five minutes rake
them out, brush off the ashes, and devour quickly.
Any ashes adhering after the brushing process can be
readily removed by cutting out the irregularities in
the crust where they have lodged. The writer has
known a party of ladies, who could scarcely be induced
to taste these cakes at first, become so fond of them
after a trial as to insist upon having them three times
a day for a week in camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>


<h4>Baking Powder Biscuits.</h4>

<p>Put one pint of flour into a deep vessel, mix into it
two large teaspoonfuls of baking powder<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and a pinch
of salt; then rub in one small teaspoonful of lard or
butter, lessening the amount of salt if the latter is
used, and add enough cold water or milk to make a
soft dough. Handle as little as possible, but roll into
a sheet about three-quarters of an inch thick, and cut
into round cakes with an empty tin cup. Lay the biscuits
close together in a well-greased tin, and bake a
few minutes in the coals, as described above for
Johnnycake.</p>


<h4>Hecker's Flour Biscuits.</h4>

<p>Require only the mixing of the flour with water, and
are then ready to bake.</p>


<h4>Quick Camp Bread.</h4>

<p>Make a biscuit dough as above, and roll it to a
thickness of half an inch. Grease a frying-pan and
set it over the hot embers till the grease begins to
melt. Then put the dough into the pan and set it on
the fire, shaking it frequently to prevent the dough
from adhering. When the crust has formed on the
bottom, take the bread out of the pan and prop it up
on edge, close to the fire, turning it occasionally to
insure its being baked through. Or, turn the bread in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the frying pan until it is cooked through. This bread
will not keep soft long, and the writer prefers, when
depending for any length of time upon his own baking,
to make</p>


<h4>Unleavened Bread.</h4>

<p>This is the kind almost wholly used by coasting
vessels, and is cooked as above in a frying-pan, even
when there is a galley-stove with a good hot oven on
board the vessel. The dough is mixed up with a
quart of wheat flour, one teaspoonful of lard, a teaspoonful
of salt and sufficient water to make it stiff.
It is then beaten or hammered lustily on a board or
smooth log until it becomes elastic. When cut up into
biscuit it can be baked in the portable oven among
the coals. It is called "Maryland Biscuit" along the
Potomac and Chesapeake.</p>


<h4>Fried and Boiled Eggs</h4>

<p>Are so easy to prepare that no instruction is necessary
in these familiar methods of cooking them.</p>


<h4>Poached Eggs.</h4>

<p>Into a frying pan nearly full of boiling water containing
a teaspoonful of salt slip carefully the eggs one by
one, breaking each previously into a cup. Keep them
on the surface of the water, if possible, and boil gently
three or four minutes, dipping up some of the water
with a spoon and pouring it over the tops of the eggs.
Serve on toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h4>Scrambled Eggs.</h4>

<p>Break the eggs into a cup to insure their freshness,
and throw them into the frying pan with a lump of
butter and salt and pepper. Stir over a fire of coals until
they are almost hard. Do not break the yolks at
first.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> remarks given on outfit in Chapter I. of Part I.
are, many of them, as well adapted to camp as to
canoe cookery. The utensils carried for cooking in a
permanent camp, and for more than one person, will
of course exceed in number those used by the canoeist,
but there will be few additional articles really necessary,
even with the varied and extensive bill-of-fare
that the possibilities of a three weeks' camp in one place
suggest. Even if you have teams and lumber-wagons
to carry your outfit into the woods it is better to go
light as possible. With few things to find places for
the camp can be kept neat and ship-shape, and everything
will be handy; while the chances are that a portion
of a large and varied outfit will be wasted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Two friends and myself go regularly into camp for
three weeks with no added utensils to those mentioned
in the canoe outfit except an iron pot and a Dutch
oven, and even these additions are seldom used. A
large cooking outfit for a camp can be best packed in
a large pack basket, such as is generally used in the
Adirondacks and Maine woods; but these receptacles
are not waterproof, therefore I would recommend that
the eatables themselves be carried in waterproofed
muslin bags, each variety having its own bag. All
together may then be packed in basket, chest or knapsack,
as desired. Butter will keep sweet longer in an
earthen jar with water-tight cover, as described on
page 11, than in any other receptacle I know of. It
can be enveloped in a net and lowered to the bottom
of a lake or river, or set in a cold spring, or tucked
away in the coolest corner of a little cellar dug into a
side hill and lined with clean birch bark. If I carry a
dozen or two of eggs into the woods with me I let
them ride in a tin pail along with plenty of corn meal,
and seldom find a broken one among them.</p>

<p>A good many campers&mdash;and especially lady campers&mdash;think
it necessary to carry a camp stove; some people
go into the woods with an ice-box and a ton of ice;
and others bring with them bedsteads and hair mattresses.
I do not camp with such people, and I think
every true woodsman will agree with me that these
deluded persons do not enjoy to the full the pleasure
and wholesome exhilaration of real camp life. A bed
of spruce or hemlock browse, properly "shingled" and
of a good depth, is the cleanest, softest, most fragrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and healthful couch in the world. If I never camped
for any other reason, I would go once a year for the
express purpose of enjoying for a brief season the
delicious odor and natural elastic softness of this best
of beds.</p>

<p>I have never felt the need of ice or ice-box in all
my camping experience. A cold spring of water keeps
my butter sweet, and I never send to town for butchered
meat; if I did perhaps I should find a refrigerator
useful.</p>

<p>Now as to camp stoves. A camp of lumbermen
will find a stove of some sort a time-saving utensil, for
but little time can be spared from their work in the
woods to prepare meals, and a dinner can be unquestionably
got quicker on a stove than with an open
fire. But to a party of pleasure outers whose time in
camp is not of so great importance, a camp stove is a
superfluous piece of furniture. It is unwieldy to carry,
smutty to handle, and makes a camp look like a summer
kitchen in a back-yard. Every necessary culinary
operation can be performed equally well or even better
without it, if the camper knows how to properly
make a cooking camp-fire.</p>

<p>The fire, in summer, should not be made so close
to the tent as to make that sleeping and lounging
place too warm, nor should it be made so far away as
to tire the cook from running back and forth with the
cooking utensils and grub. Two green logs, five or
six feet long and eight to twelve inches in diameter,
of a nearly even thickness throughout, are laid on a
level piece of ground side by side, about a foot apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at one end, and touching at the other, thus forming
an elongated V. With a hatchet hew them on their
upper sides until the surface is level enough to support
pots and pans in safety. Between these logs
build your fire. This should not be done carelessly,
but methodically and with patience. Begin with only
as many dry shavings as you can grasp in your hand.
When these are ablaze, add shavings and bits of dry
wood of a little larger size, and then those a little
larger than the last, and so on, increasing the size of
the sticks very gradually and leading the fire by degrees
until it covers all the space between the logs.</p>

<p>When the fire is well under way and blazing brightly
at all points, pile on it plenty of split sticks, short, and
as near a uniform size as possible, and let them all
burn to coals before cooking is commenced. If some
of the sticks are large and some small, they will not
burn evenly, and by the time the larger ones have become
coals, the coals of the smaller ones will have
become ashes. And if the sticks are round instead
of split, they will not catch fire so easily, and will
nest so close together as to give insufficient draft.
Driftwood will do to start a fire, but it should never
be used after the blaze is well going, because it
burns to ashes instead of coals. The best coals
result from burning hard wood. Never put a
cooking utensil on the fire until the smoke and
blaze have ceased. When you have a good bed of
coals set the coffee pot on near where the logs join,
and the frying pan, large pot, etc., where the logs
are further apart. If there is much wind, ashes will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
be blown about to some extent, and it is best to
always keep the open end of the "range" to windward,
as the frying pan is generally set on this end,
while the coffee pot and other pots being covered, can
stand a shower of ashes without harm to their contents.
As fast as one dish is cooked, set it on one of
the logs where it will keep warm, and use the handy
blacksmith's pliers to heap up the live coals under
other dishes that are not cooking fast enough.</p>

<p>These pliers can be made by any blacksmith, and
should be from twelve to eighteen inches in length,
and quite broad in the gripping part, which may with
advantage be curved to a slight angle. I always use
a frying pan without handle for compactness, and can
lift it from any side of the fire with the pliers, which
are always cool. I even grip the coffee pot with them
and pour the coffee for the whole party without touching
it with my hands, saving many a scorch thereby.
It is a handy tool in making repairs to boats, and in
various other ways proves its value as a necessary
part of the camp outfit. The coffee pot should not
have a spout, but a lip, riveted on, near its topmost
edge. The handle should also be riveted, and should
set as near as possible to the top of the pot. A wire
bale may be attached for handiness in lifting.</p>

<p>The cooking range above described will suffice for
nearly all branches of camp cookery. On it one can
fry, broil and boil. When a boil is to be kept up for
hours, however, as in cooking beans, greens, and some
soups and stews, it will be necessary to set up a forked
stake at each end of the fire, hang the kettle on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
cross-piece between, and keep up the fire beneath by
constant feeding and attention. Do not let the blaze
mount so high as to burn or char the cross-piece.</p>

<p>The fire for baking should be made apart from the
range. A hole in the ground a little more than deep
enough to contain the bake-kettle or Dutch oven
should be dug, and of sufficient diameter to allow four
or five inches' space on each side of the oven when it
is in the hole. Build up a good fire in the hole, and
when you have a large quantity of hot coals and ashes,
dig out all but a thick layer on the bottom, set in your
oven, and pack it all around and on top with the coals
and ashes. Cover the whole with a piece of turf or
some earth. When baking without an oven, as fish in
clay, a bird in its feathers, or a 'possum in its own
hide, dig out nearly all the coals, put some green grass
or leaves in the bottom, then the fish, bird or beast,
then more grass or leaves, then coals and ashes, then
earth, and lastly build a small fire on top and keep it
burning steadily.</p>

<p>In all the baking recipes recommended in this
book a certain time is given for each operation. This
time mentioned is only approximate, and it will be
found to vary a few minutes, according to the amount
of coal used, the kind of firewood, etc. The time
necessary to bake a given thing can only be learned
exactly by practical experience; but this experience
will teach the cook all he needs to know after the first
two or three attempts.</p>

<p>In closing my remarks on fires I would suggest that
the best wood to be obtained for cooking fires is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
from hard wood trees that have fallen in the woods or
been cut down, and have lain long enough to become
well seasoned. If this is used the fire will stand any
ordinary rain, and the camper will not be compelled
to resort to his alcohol stove under shelter for any
thing short of the equinoctial storm. If wood is
damp, a few drops of kerosene, gun oil or alcohol
sprinkled on it will be a valuable aid in starting a fire.</p>

<p>I have no love for kerosene stoves. The alcohol
"flamme forcé" is more compact, gives a stronger
heat (have two, set side by side), and is perfectly
clean. If, however, you must take along a kerosene
stove, the wind-protected kind manufactured by Adams
&amp; Westlake (5 East Fourteenth Street, New York, and
78 Washington Street, Boston) will probably be found
the most suitable. Neither the kerosene nor the alcohol
stoves should be used when an outdoor fire can be
built.</p>

<p>A camp dining-table can be made by driving down
four forked stakes in the corners of an imaginary rectangle.
Connect the end stakes with cross-pieces, and
lay planks from one cross-piece to the other. Make it
just high enough to get the legs and feet under comfortably
when sitting upon the ground, and build it
away from the fire. A camp chest makes a good table,
so does a large log with one side hewed level. Each
member of a party that I frequently camp with has a
tin or wooden box in which fishing tackle, cartridges,
tools, etc., are carried. When dinner is prepared a
piece of spare canvas is laid upon the grass, the tin
dishes and edibles are put upon this, then each man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
brings his box to the particular corner of the cloth he
selects, sits on the grass, crosses his legs, and has each
his individual table in his own private box, the cover
of which is large enough to hold a tin plate, tin cup,
knife and fork, etc.</p>

<p>By all means wash the dishes immediately after each
meal. You can smoke your post-prandial pipe and do
this at the same time. Have a pot or kettle of water
heating while you are eating, and if the frying pan
is dirty, fill it with water and let it boil over the coals
awhile. Put your dishes into the largest pail, pour hot
water over them, tone it down with cold water so you
can handle them, and wash the dishes, the least dirty
first, with a sponge. Sapolio is good to scour them,
but sand is better. Soap is less often used by male
campers in dish-washing than it should be. It makes
the work much easier. When washed, rinse the tin-ware
in cold water, drain and dry with a towel. Wring
out the sponge in clean water, and hang it on a bush
ready for use again.</p>

<p>Remove all refuse and leavings to a good distance
from camp, and never allow the vicinity of the tent to
become littered up with tomato cans, old cartridge
shells, bones, feathers, corn-husks, etc.</p>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Soups.&mdash;General Remarks on Cooking Soups.&mdash;Soups made of
Meat, Vegetables, Deer's Heads, Small Game, Rice,
Fish and Turtle.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Soups</span> should be made in camp as often as the
materials are at hand. They are wholesome and invigorating,
and not difficult to prepare; and so many
different kinds can be made that no camper's appetite
need be cloyed by lack of variety. Most canned soups
are excellent, and the directions for cooking which
come with them should be closely followed.</p>

<p>The time given for cooking soups in the recipes
that follow may seem unnecessarily long, but if it is
done in a less time, it is at a loss in the flavor. Fast
boiling drives off considerable of the aroma of the ingredients
used, the water evaporates fast and requires
constant replenishing with boiling water, which compels
the cook to have an additional vessel always on
the fire. Constant skimming is necessary, and an
occasional slight stirring will prevent any of the
vegetables from burning on the pot where but little
water is used.</p>

<p>Campers do not commonly have fresh meat in camp,
unless in a portion of the country where venison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
buffalo or bear meat form a part of the larder. With
any one of these, or with beef, we can make what I
will call</p>


<h4>Meat Soup.</h4>

<p>Use one pound of lean meat (cut into pieces the
size of an egg) to a quart of water. Put on the fire
with the water cold, and let it heat gradually and
simmer rather than boil, skimming it constantly and
keeping the cover on the pot when this operation is
not being performed. If any cooked meat or bones
are to be added, this should be done after the soup
has cooked three-quarters of an hour. From four and
a half to five hours are necessary for the soup to cook.
Just before it is done, season with salt and pepper. If
made in an iron pot it should be transferred as soon
as done to a tin or earthen vessel. In cold weather
this soup may be kept fresh and sweet for a week
and "warmed over" as long as it lasts.</p>


<h4>Vegetable Soup.</h4>

<p>Onions, potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets, parsnips,
cabbage, cauliflower, pumpkins, squash, etc., should be
picked over, washed, pared, and cut into small pieces
from a quarter to a half-inch thick, put into a pan of
cold water, rinsed and drained. Tomatoes should be
scalded, peeled and sliced. Prepare a meat soup as
above, and when it has cooked four hours put in all
your vegetables except potatoes, which should be put
in only about thirty minutes before the soup is done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Stir the soup occasionally to prevent the vegetables
from scorching or sticking to the bottom of the pot,
and skim frequently. When done take out the vegetables,
mash and return them to the soup, boil one
minute, season and serve. Canned corn or tomatoes
may be used in this soup the same as fresh vegetables.</p>


<h4>Deer's Head Soup.</h4>

<p>Skin the head and split it in pieces, remove the
eyes and brains, and wash thoroughly in cold water.
Then cook same as meat soup.</p>


<h4>Small Game Soup.</h4>

<p>Squirrels, rabbits, and small game generally can be
cleaned and split and made into soup as above. When
vegetables are added to soup made of small game, the
latter should be removed and strained, and the good
meat returned to the pot just before the vegetables
are put in, leaving out all the bones, skin, gristle, etc.</p>


<h4>Rice Soup.</h4>

<p>Make a meat soup, with the addition of one sliced
onion. Prepare the rice (one-half pound to a gallon
of water) by picking it over, washing and draining,
and stir it into the soup half an hour before it is done,
stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>


<h4>Bean Soup.</h4>

<p>Pick over two quarts of beans, wash, and soak them
over night in cold water. Scrape clean one pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
salt pork, and cut into thin slices. Drain the beans,
put them into six quarts of cold water, with one tablespoonful
of soda, and let them boil gently for half an
hour, skimming constantly. Then drain off all the
water and put in the same amount of fresh boiling
water. Boil slowly for an hour and a half, stirring
frequently; then put in the pork. When the beans
have become tender enough to crack, take out the
pork and mash the beans into a paste with a wooden
masher or the bottom of a large bottle. Then put all
back and boil slowly an hour longer. If no soda is
used, longer boiling will be necessary. Bean soup
will burn if not constantly stirred. Not much salt,
but plenty of pepper should be used for seasoning.</p>


<h4>Pea Soup.</h4>

<p>Treat the peas exactly the same as the beans in the
above recipe, except as to the preliminary boiling in
water with soda. Make the same way as bean soup.
Pea soup cools and thickens rapidly, therefore if
squares of fried bread are thrown upon the surface
before serving, it should be done quickly and while
the bread is hot. Use more salt than with the bean
soup for seasoning, and boil gently or it will surely
burn.</p>


<h4>Fish Soup.</h4>

<p>Cut up large fish, after it has been cooled from a
previous cooking, into small pieces, and stew it with a
piece of salt pork for two hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>


<h4>Turtle Soup.</h4>

<p>Snapping turtles, "mud turtles" and all tortoises
can be made into appetizing soup. Cut their throats
to kill them and then let them bleed. Break the shell
on the under side, cut out the meat, rejecting the
entrails, head and claws, and boil slowly for three
hours with some sliced onion.</p>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Fish.&mdash;Fish Baked, Plain and Stuffed.&mdash;Fish Gravy.&mdash;Fish
Chowder.&mdash;Clam Chowder.&mdash;Orthodox Clam Chowder.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of fish cookery belongs more to the
canoeist than to the general camper, for the
reason that the former is so constantly among them in
their fluid home that he can readily catch a mess, and
easily cook them with his small means after he has
caught them. That is why nearly all the practical
methods of cooking fish are given in Chapter III. of
Part I. of this book. There are, however, some ways
of preparing fish in camp that the canoeist will hardly
attempt, for lack of time or utensils, and these methods
will be given here.</p>


<h4>Plain Baked Fish.</h4>

<p>Dig a hole in the ground eighteen inches deep and
large enough to contain the fish; build a fire in it and
let it burn to coals. Remove the coals, leaving the hot
ashes in the bottom, on which place a thick layer of
green grass. Put the fish on the grass, cover with
another layer of grass; then rake back the coals and
loose earth and build a small fire on top. In an hour
the baking will be complete, the skin will peel off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
leave the flesh clean. A fish prepared this way need
not be scaled, but only disembowelled, as the scales
will come off with the skin after it is cooked.</p>


<h4>Stuffed Baked Fish.</h4>

<p>Only a large fish should be cooked in this manner,
as it is hardly worth the trouble to stuff a small fish.
Prepare a stuffing of bread or cracker crumbs, with
enough butter or lard to make the mixture moist.
Season with pepper and salt, and chop up with it
one onion, and a little summer savory or sage, if
desired. Clean and wipe the fish dry, put in the
stuffing lightly and then sew up the opening. Lay
the fish in the bake-kettle or Dutch oven, rub it all
over with butter or lard and dredge it with flour, meal
or some of the dry crumbs left over from the stuffing.
Or, lay thin strips of fat salt pork or bacon on the top.
Pour a little boiling water into the bottom to prevent
the fish adhering, close the bake-kettle and put it into
the fire among the hottest coals. In a very hot oven
it should be done in forty minutes. Remove the
bake-kettle several times before it is done to baste it.
When cooked, serve with the following</p>


<h4>Fish Gravy.</h4>

<p>Put the bake-kettle back on the fire after the fish is
removed; stir into the gravy left, gradually, two tablespoonfuls
of flour. Let it boil up once, season with
pepper and salt, and pour over the fish. If there are
squeamish people in camp remove the "black specks"
from this gravy with a spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<h4>Fish Chowder.</h4>

<p>Clean the fish and cut up all except the heads and
tails into small pieces, leaving out as many bones as
possible. Cover the bottom of the pot with slices of
fat salt pork; over that a layer of sliced raw potatoes;
then a layer of chopped onions; then a layer
of fish; on the fish a layer of crackers, first made
tender by soaking in water or milk. Repeat the layers,
except pork, till the pot is nearly full. Every
layer must be seasoned with pepper and salt. Put
in enough cold water to moisten the whole mass
well, cover the pot closely, set over a gentle fire,
and let it simmer an hour or so. Cook it till it is
rather thick, then stir it gently, and it is ready to
serve. Tomatoes may be added as a layer after the
onions.</p>


<h4>Clam Chowder</h4>

<p>Can be made the same as Fish Chowder, using
clams instead of fish, but a large party of sea-beach
picnickers will probably prefer the regular</p>


<h4>Orthodox Clam Chowder.</h4>

<p>The first thing necessary is an out-door oven made
with flat stones. Start a rousing fire in this and let it
burn until every stone is hot all the way through.
Then rake out the coals beneath, even to the faintest
cinder, so that there will be no smoky taste to the
chowder. Then put a couple of stout boughs across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the open top of the oven, and cover them with fresh
seaweed an inch or two thick. Spread the shelled
clams on the seaweed, over them a layer of onions,
then a layer of sweet or Irish potatoes, or both, then
green corn, then the fish (cleaned and salted and
mapped in a cloth, and either a bluefish or a cod, if
extra-orthodox), then a lobster, either alive or boiled.
Now cover the whole arrangement with a large cloth,
and pile on seaweed till no steam escapes. When it
has cooked half an hour or so let the company attack
it <i>en masse</i>, uncovering it gradually as it is eaten, so as
to retain the heat in it as long as possible. The
stones should be extremely and thoroughly heated, or
the chowder will be a failure, and the cinders should
be cleaned out, the chowder put on, and the whole
covered with great haste, so as not to give the stones
a chance to cool.</p>

Game.&mdash;Woodchucks, Porcupines, 'Possums and Pigs.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> good recipes for cooking meats and game,
which are not given in Part I., are the following:</p>


<h4>Frizzled Beef.</h4>

<p>Cut dried beef into very thin shavings, and put into
a frying pan nearly half full of cold water. Set over
the fire and let it come to a boil, then stir in a large
lump of butter and enough flour to make a good
gravy.</p>


<h4>Hash.</h4>

<p>Four pounds of cold boiled meat (not pork) or
corned beef, free from bone or gristle, one large parboiled
onion, and two pounds of boiled or baked potatoes
are chopped and mixed together, seasoned with
pepper and salt, and stirred up with about a pint of
hot water. Put enough lard or butter into a frying
pan to well cover the bottom when melted, and when
it is "screeching hot," put in the hash. Stir it for a
few minutes, then let it fry till it is brown on the
bottom. Corned beef hash requires little salt for
seasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>


<h4>Boiled Pork.</h4>

<p>Soak over night in cold water and put into a pot of
cold water over the fire when the boiling begins.
Boil same as other meat (see page 27) and save the
cake of fat that rises when it is cold for frying purposes.
Turnips, cabbage, potatoes and greens are
good boiled with the pork. See table for boiling vegetables
in the next chapter.</p>


<h4>Pork Hash.</h4>

<p>Cut salt pork or bacon into small dice, and while it
is frying over a slow fire cut raw potatoes and onions
into thin slices, put them with the pork, cover the frying
pan and cook for ten minutes, occasionally stirring.</p>


<h4>Pork and Beans.</h4>

<p>The right proportions are two quarts of beans to
three pounds of pork. Pick over the beans at night,
wash them, and put them to soak in cold water until
the next morning. Then if only boiled pork and
beans are desired, drain the beans, and put them with
the pork in the pot, just cover with cold water, set
over the fire (with the cover on the pot), and boil till
the beans are tender, skimming the scum off as it
rises. If baked beans are wanted parboil the pork
and cut it into thin slices, then drain the beans and
boil as above. Put half the beans into the bake-kettle,
then the pork, then the remainder of the beans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
pour over them half a pint of boiling water. Bake
among the coals till the top is crusted brown. If
buried in the ground with a good supply of coals it is
best to put them in at night when going to bed, and
they will be done in the morning. If the bake-kettle
is enveloped in hot coals on the surface of the ground
they will bake on the outside quicker, but inside,
where the pork is, they will not be baked at all. This
latter method, therefore, should only be used when in
a hurry, and in this case the pork should be scattered
around in different portions of the pot, and the beans
left may be re-baked for another meal.</p>


<h4>Game Stew.</h4>

<p>Cut up any kind of game, whether furred or feathered,
into small pieces, wash it, and put it in a pot
with some pork cut into pieces three inches square,
and rather more than enough water to cover it all.
Let it boil for half an hour, skimming off the particles
that rise to the top. Then add four or five sliced
onions, some parsley or summer savory, salt and pepper,
and boil slowly for an hour and a half. Half an hour
before it is done put in a few pared potatoes, cut to a
uniform size.</p>


<h4>Brunswick Stew.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h4>

<p>For a stew for five or six persons the following are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the ingredients: two-good-sized or three small squirrels,
one quart of tomatoes, peeled and sliced, one
pint of butter or lima beans, six potatoes, parboiled
and sliced, six ears of green corn cut from the cob,
one-half pound of butter, one-half a pound of fat salt
pork, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one-half a teaspoonful
of cayenne, one gallon of water, one tablespoonful
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of white sugar,
one onion minced small. Cut the squirrels into joints,
and lay in cold water to draw out the blood; put on
the gallon of water, with the salt in it, and let it boil
for five minutes; put in the onion, beans, corn, pork
which has been cut into fine strips, potatoes, pepper
and the squirrels; cover closely, and stew two and
a-half hours very slowly, stirring the mass frequently
from the bottom to prevent its burning. Then add
the tomatoes and sugar, and stew an hour longer.
Ten minutes before it is to be taken from the fire, add
the butter, cut into bits the size of a walnut, and rolled
in flour; give a final boil, taste to see that it is seasoned
to your liking, and serve at once.</p>


<h4>Flour Gravy.</h4>

<p>After stews have been taken from the pot stir a
tablespoonful of flour gradually into a small quantity
of cold water, carefully breaking all the lumps. Then
pour this gradually into the boiling liquor left in the
pot from the stew, let it boil well two minutes, and
serve. If flour is sprinkled dry into boiling water it
Will form into lumps at once, no matter how much it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
stirred. A tablespoonful of flour will sufficiently
thicken nearly a quart of liquor. If what is called
"brown gravy" is desired, heat the flour first in a frying
pan, stirring it till it is brown.</p>


<h4>Roast Venison.</h4>

<p>The saddle is the best portion for roasting, and
after this the shoulder. Hang it by a cord over a huge
bed of coals, or use the crotched stakes, impaling the
venison on the cross-piece. Insert thin slices of salt
pork or bacon in gashes cut with a knife where the
flesh is thick enough to admit of "gashing," or
skewer them on with hard wood twigs where it is not.
Turn frequently. The flesh on the surface will
become hard by the time the roast is done, but this
can be avoided by covering it with buttered paper fastened
on with wooden skewers. From two to three
hours are required for roasting.</p>


<h4>Baked Deer's Head.</h4>

<p>Build a fire in a hole in the ground. When it has
burned to a good bed of coals put in the deer's head,
neck downward, with the skin on but the eyes and
brains removed. Cover with green grass or leaves,
coals and earth, and build a new fire on top of all. In
about six hours exhume the head, remove the skin, and
the baking is complete. This method of baking
applies as well to the head of any animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>


<h4>Forequarter of Venison.</h4>

<p>This portion is always tough, but may be utilized by
stewing it, or making it into</p>


<h4>Venison Sausages.</h4>

<p>Chop up pieces of the forequarter, mix with half as
much chopped salt pork, season with pepper and salt,
make into balls, and fry.</p>


<h4>Stuffed Shoulder of Venison.</h4>

<p>If you are very "swell" campers-out, and have
some port or Madeira wine with you, you may stew
the shoulder of venison in the following manner:
Extract the bones through the under side and make a
stuffing as follows: Chop up suet very fine, and mix
it with bread crumbs, in the proportion of half a pint
of suet to a quart of breadcrumbs. Moisten this with
wine, season with pepper and allspice and fill the holes
from which the bones were taken. Bind firmly in
shape with strips of clean cloth, put in a large saucepan
with part of a gravy made by boiling the trimmings
of the venison; add to this a glass of port or
Madeira wine and a little black pepper. Cover
tightly and stew very slowly three or four hours,
according to the size. It should be very tender when
done. Remove the strips of cotton cloth with care,
dish, and, when you have strained the gravy, pour it
over the meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>


<h4>Stuffed Game Roasted.</h4>

<p>Large birds (ducks or turkeys, etc.), rabbits, hares,
woodchucks, porcupines, opossums, and the like, may
be stuffed with a dressing made of salt pork and bread
or crackers. Chop the pork very fine, soak the bread
or crackers in hot water and mash them smooth, and
mix them with the chopped pork. Season with pepper,
a little salt, sage and chopped onion. Sew up the game
after stuffing with wire in two or three places, and
roast over hot coals. If wrapped in wet brown paper
it may be immersed in hot ashes and baked, if small,
or may be baked the same as fish.</p>


<h4>Woodchucks and Porcupines.</h4>

<p>When properly cooked, are little inferior to any game.
They must be thoroughly parboiled before cooking,
and then may be roasted or stewed. A young wood-chuck
or porcupine may be baked in the ground with
the hide on, after having been drawn, and is very palatable.</p>


<h4>Opossums and Young Pigs</h4>

<p>Are roasted alike. After cleaning the opossum or
pig stuff him with bread crumbs, chopped onion and
sage or summer savory for seasoning, boiled Irish and
sweet potatoes (the latter especially with the 'possum)
and whole boiled onions being pushed in among the
dressing. Wire up the opening in two or three places,
fold the legs down on the body and wire them fast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Then cut a strong, straight, hard-wood limb, and run
it through the animal from stern to snout. This is to
be suspended from two crotched stakes over the fire,
and, if smooth, the 'possum or pig cannot be turned
on it, as the limb will turn inside the animal. Therefore,
in lopping off the twigs from the limb after it is
cut, leave half an inch or so of each twig to act as a
barb, insert the limb in the animal butt first, then give
it a "yank" backward so that the barbs may hold
when it is desired to turn the animal to roast all sides
alike. Cut gashes in the thickest parts of the meat so
that it may roast evenly throughout. A 'possum or
pig prepared as above may be coated with clay and
baked in the ground with plenty of coals in from two
to three hours. When roasted over the fire the drippings
should be caught and used to baste it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">All</span> vegetables must be carefully looked over. Remove
the unripe or decayed parts, and then wash
in cold water. When to be boiled they should be put
in boiling salted water, and if necessary to replenish

</p></blockquote>

<p>If a piece of lean salt pork is boiled with some of the
above, they will be sufficiently seasoned. If not,
season with salt, pepper and butter.</p>


<h4>Potatoes and Corn.</h4>

<p>For all methods of cooking these vegetables, see
Chapter V. of Part I.</p>


<h4>Boiled Cabbage.</h4>

<p>Remove the outer and all bad leaves, examining
carefully for insects, and halve or quarter the cabbage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
according to size. Wash, soak a short time in cold
water, and put in a covered pot of boiling salted
water. When it is tender and "smells good" it is
done. Drain, and press out the water, seasoning with
salt, pepper and butter. The latter should be omitted
if it is boiled with pork.</p>


<h4>Cabbage aux Legumes.</h4>

<p>Cut out the centre of a large cabbage, and fill the
hole with small potatoes, onions, parsnips, beets, etc.
Cover with a cloth and boil till tender.</p>


<h4>Fried Cooked Cabbage.</h4>

<p>Have enough lard in the pan to just cover the bottom
when melted. Chop the cabbage, put into the
melted lard and stir frequently till the cabbage is piping
hot, when it is ready to serve.</p>


<h4>Succotash.</h4>

<p>Cut the corn from the cob and shell the beans. If
string beans are used, string and cut into half-inch
pieces. The right proportion for succotash is two-thirds
corn to one-third beans. Put them into enough
boiling salt water to cover them. Stew gently till
tender, stirring frequently; then drain, add a cup of
milk and a piece of butter the size of an egg, and stir
till it boils up once. Season to taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<h4>Boiled Beets.</h4>

<p>Winter beets must be soaked over night in water.
Wash them, but do not scrape or cut them, as they
lose in color and quality by being cut. Put them in
boiling water enough to cover them well, cover and
boil till tender, which will take from one to three
hours. Then put them in cold water and rub off the
skins quickly. If large, slice them; if young, split
lengthwise.</p>


<h4>Greens.</h4>

<p>When in camp or on a cruise, a most delicious dish
can be made of boiled greens, of which a large variety
of weeds and plants furnishes the material. Dandelion
leaves, nettles, milkweed, spinach, young beet
tops, turnip tops, mustard, narrow dock, mountain
cow-slip, kale, cabbage, poke, sprouts and other
"weeds" are good. They should be picked over carefully,
washed in three or four waters, and soaked in
cold water half an hour; then drain and put in enough
boiling salt water to cover them. Press them down
till the pot is full, as they "boil away" and lose more
than half in substance. Cover, and boil steadily
till tender. Then drain and press out the water.
Season to taste with butter, pepper and salt. Greens
are good boiled with salt pork, bacon, corned beef or
ham. Put them in the pot in time to be done with the
meat.</p>


<h4>Stewed Tomatoes.</h4>

<p>Peel by pouring over them boiling water, when the
skin will easily come off. Cut up, discarding unripe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and hard parts. Put into a pot, seasoning with butter,
pepper, salt, and if very acid, two tablespoonfuls of
sugar. Cover, and stew gently. See time table.</p>


<h4>Boiled Turnips.</h4>

<p>Wash and peel, and if old, pare off part of the
"meat" next the skin. Cut into pieces of a uniform
size, soak in cold water half an hour, put into enough
boiling salt water to cover them, cover, and cook according
to time table. Season with butter, pepper
and salt. Omit the butter if they are cooked with
meat.</p>


<h4>Mushrooms.</h4>

<p>Edible mushrooms are found in clear, open, sunny
fields and elevated ground where the air is pure and
fresh; poisonous ones are found in woods, low, damp
ground, in shady places and upon putrefying substances.
The edible kind are most plentiful in August
and September, and spring up after low lying fogs,
soaking dews or heavy rains. They first appear very
small and of a round form, on a little stalk, the upper
part and stalk being then white. They grow very fast,
and, as the size increases, the under part gradually
opens and shows a fringy fur (called "gills") of a delicate
salmon color. After the mushroom is a day old
this salmon color changes to a russet or dark brown.
The gills of the poisonous variety are red, green, blue,
yellow or orange red, and sometimes white, but they
never have the delicate salmon color of the edible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
mushroom. The latter have an agreeable odor, and
the poisonous have sometimes a similar odor, but generally
smell fetid. The flesh of the edible kind is compact
and brittle; that of the poisonous generally soft
and watery. The skin of the former is easily peeled
from the edges, and the seeds or sprouts are for the
most part roundish or oval; the skin of the latter is
not easy to peel and the seeds are mostly angular.
Some poisonous ones assume a bluish tint on being
bruised and others exude an acrid, milky juice. The
mushroom should have all of the above-named characteristics
of the edible variety before it is put in the
pot, and it is safest not to select mushrooms gathered
by somebody else, as they change color after being
picked several hours, and the two kinds are then difficult
to distinguish. Finally, if a white peeled onion
cooked with them turns black, or if a silver spoon with
which they are stirred while cooking turns black, don't
eat them; and if you don't know a salmon color from
a yellow let somebody gather them who does.</p>


<h4>Stewed Mushrooms.</h4>

<p>Select mushrooms of uniform size. Wipe them clean
with a soft cloth; peel, commencing at the edge and
finishing at the top; cut off the lower part of the
stem; put them into a tin or earthen vessel and half
cover them with cold water, and stew gently for fifteen
minutes, frequently stirring to prevent burning; season
with pepper and salt. When the stew is done stir
into it one or more tablespoonfuls of butter, previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
cut in small pieces, and rolled in flour; stir three or
four minutes. Do not let it boil.</p>


<h4>Fried Mushrooms.</h4>

<p>Prepare as directed for stewing; heat in a frying
pan enough butter to thinly cover the bottom; put in
the mushrooms and fry both sides a golden brown.</p>


<h4>Broiled Mushrooms.</h4>

<p>Prepare as above, put on a broiler with gills uppermost,
sprinkle on a little salt and pepper and a tiny
piece of butter, and hold over a bed of coals.</p>


<h4>Fried Beans.</h4>

<p>Put enough butter in a frying pan to just cover the
bottom when melted. When it is hot put in your
beans, already boiled and drained, and fry brown,
stirring occasionally.</p>

Cakes.&mdash;Rice Cakes.&mdash;Puddings.&mdash;Welsh Rarebit.&mdash;Fried
Bread for Soups.&mdash;Stewed Cranberries.</span></p></blockquote>


<h4>Boiled Rice.</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Pick</span> one pound of rice over carefully and wash it
clean in one or two cold waters, then drain and put
it into a pot containing four quarts of boiling water, and
add four teaspoonfuls of salt; cover and boil steadily
for fifteen minutes, then drain off the water, empty the
rice, wipe out the pot, sprinkle a little salt over the
bottom of it and rub it with a dry cloth, finally emptying
out the salt, replacing the rice and setting the pot
near the fire for fifteen minutes longer to let the rice
dry and swell. If a large pot is at hand a better way
after the rice has boiled fifteen minutes is to drain it as
above, then pouring the boiling water into the large
pot, set in the dry rice in the smaller one, which
should be put in the larger one and all set over the
fire and the rice allowed to steam thoroughly dry, which
will take fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The writer followed the above recipe implicitly till
he discovered that nothing further is necessary to
cook rice to his own particular taste than the boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
fifteen minutes. Since making this discovery he has
omitted the further portion of the recipe in practice,
but gives it here for the benefit of those whose tastes
may be more dainty than his own.</p>


<h4>Cracked Wheat.</h4>

<p>To one quart of the wheat add one tablespoonful
of salt, and soak over night in cold water enough to
cover it. In the morning put the wheat with the
water it was soaked in into a pot, cover closely and
cook gently until soft&mdash;probably from one to one and
one-half hours&mdash;stirring frequently to prevent scorching.
When necessary to replenish the water add boiling
water.</p>


<h4>Hominy Grits</h4>

<p>Are cooked the same as cracked wheat, and are very
wholesome. Coarse hominy requires long boiling.</p>


<h4>Batter Cakes.</h4>

<p>Put one quart of sifted flour in a deep dish, and mix
with it one-half teaspoonful of salt, two heaping teaspoonfuls
of baking powder and one teaspoonful of
sugar. Add warm water (milk is better) sufficient to
make a thick batter. Then add two eggs, beaten light,
and if they do not thin down the batter sufficiently,
add more water (or milk). Beat thoroughly and cook
immediately the same as slapjacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<h4>Rice Cakes.</h4>

<p>Into one quart of sifted flour stir enough water (or
milk) to make a medium thick batter; add two cups
of cold boiled rice, one teaspoonful of salt, and lastly,
four eggs, beaten light. Beat thoroughly and cook
immediately the same as slapjacks.</p>


<h4>Plum Pudding.</h4>

<p>Put into a basin one pound of flour, three-quarters
of a pound of raisins (stoned, if possible), three-quarters
of a pound of fat of salt pork (well washed and
cut into small dice or chopped), and two tablespoonfuls
of sugar. Add half a pint of water and mix well
together. Dip a cloth bag large enough to hold the
pudding into boiling water, wring it out, and apply
flour well to the inside. Put in the pudding and fasten
it up, leaving a little room in the bag for the pudding
to swell. Now place the whole in enough boiling
water to cover the bag, and boil two hours, turning
the bag several times to prevent its scorching against
the bottom or sides of the pot. If necessary to add
water to keep the bag covered, add boiling water.
When done take the pudding from the pot, plunge it
into cold water for an instant, and then turn it out to
be eaten.</p>


<h4>Omaha Pudding.</h4>

<p>Mix in a deep dish one quart of sifted flour and
one tablespoonful of baking powder. Dissolve one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
heaping teaspoonful of salt in one half pint of cold
water (or milk), adding enough of the latter to the
former to make a very thick batter. Mix quickly and
boil in a bag as above.</p>


<h4>Batter Pudding.</h4>

<p>One quart of sifted flour in a deep dish worked
into a smooth paste with one quart of sweet milk;
then mix in the yolks of seven eggs, beaten well, one
teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
baking powder dissolved in a little hot water. Stir
hard and finally work in quickly the whites of the seven
eggs, which should previously have been beaten into a
stiff froth. Boil two hours in bags and leave plenty
of room for it to swell.</p>


<h4>Corn Starch Pudding.</h4>

<p>Dissolve three tablespoonfuls of corn starch in a
small quantity of milk, add two eggs, beaten light, and
a small pinch of salt. Heat three pints of milk nearly
to boiling, mix all together and boil four minutes,
constantly stirring. Dip a cup or basin in cold water
to cool it, and turn into it the pudding, which should
be eaten with sugar and milk when it is cold.</p>


<h4>Baked Rice Pudding.</h4>

<p>Pick over and wash well one pint of rice and soak
it two hours in enough milk or water to just cover it.
Then stir it into two quarts of milk, one half pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, and a small quantity
of nutmeg or cinnamon, if at hand. Put into the
baking basins, having first well greased them, and
bake in the ground two or three hours till it is done
brown.</p>


<h4>Creole Sauce.</h4>

<p>The juice of a lemon, three tablespoonfuls of sugar,
ditto of tomato catsup, one teaspoonful of mustard.
Heat all to near the boiling point, and use hot with
meats or game.</p>


<h4>Welsh Rarebit.</h4>

<p>Cut bread into slices about one inch in thickness,
and pare off the crust. Toast the slices slightly without
hardening or burning and spread with butter; cut
slices of cheese not quite as large as the bread, lay it
on the bread, and toast all over the fire on a broiler.
Be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be
equally melted. Spread over the top a little mustard
already prepared and seasoning of pepper, and serve
very hot.</p>


<h4>Fried Bread for Soups.</h4>

<p>Cut stale bread into square pieces, and fry in boiling
fat for an instant. Take care it does not burn,
removing it as soon as brown.</p>


<h4>Stewed Cranberries.</h4>

<p>Pick the berries carefully; then wash them in cold
water; drain. Put them into fresh cold water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
allow them to remain therein five or ten minutes;
drain. Then put the fruit into a well-covered pot
(not iron) with sufficient boiling water to cover the
berries. Stew rather quickly, stirring occasionally
until soft. They should cook in from twenty to thirty
minutes. Five minutes before they are done stir in
sugar to taste.</p>

<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Dishes for Yachtsmen.&mdash;Macaroni, Boiled and Baked.&mdash;Baked
Turkey.&mdash;Pie Crust.&mdash;Brown Betty.&mdash;Apple
Pudding.&mdash;Apple Dumplings.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> the benefit of Corinthian yachtsmen, recipes are
here given for some dishes which are rather too
elaborate in preparation for camp purposes, but which
can be cooked readily in the yacht's galley, if it be
provided with a regular yacht's stove, having an oven,
etc.</p>


<h4>Boiled Macaroni.</h4>

<p>Wipe the macaroni carefully, and break it into
lengths, put it into a pot of boiling salt water, say ten
times as much water as macaroni. Boil fifteen to
twenty minutes, or until tender. Take care that it
does not burst or become a pulp from excessive boiling;
drain at once and season with butter.</p>

<p>If desired to impart the flavor of onion to macaroni
boil with it two onions for each pound of macaroni.
The liquor drained from the macaroni may be
used for broth or soup.</p>

<p>Boiled macaroni may be served with a white sauce,
made as follows; for one pound of macaroni put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
into a pot over the fire two ounces of butter and two
ounces of flour, stir until it becomes smooth, then
gradually stir in one quart of hot milk and water in
equal parts, season with pepper and salt, put in the
macaroni, and let it remain over the fire for one
minute.</p>

<p>Or, as soon as the butter and flour bubbles, gradually
pour in one quart of boiling water, stirring it
until it becomes smooth; season with pepper and salt;
put in the macaroni and let it remain over the fire for
one minute. Have ready one or two onions, minced
or shredded, fried brown. Dish the macaroni and
pour the fried onions over it.</p>

<p>Boiled macaroni may be served with tomato sauce
made as follows: for one pound of macaroni put into
a pot half a can of tomatoes, or twelve large fresh ones,
one half a pint of stock, gravy, or broth of any kind,
a little thyme or parsley, six whole cloves, a sliced
onion, pepper and salt. Cover and boil gently for one
hour, stirring frequently; drain and press the mixture
through a sieve (an old pan full of nail holes will do);
then stir into it about two ounces of butter and one
ounce of flour, previously mixed smooth over the fire;
stir until it is well incorporated; pour it over the
macaroni: sprinkle on top grated cheese, and put it
into the oven for five or ten minutes.</p>


<h4>Baked Macaroni and Cheese.</h4>

<p>Boil and drain the macaroni and with it fill by layers
a buttered earthen dish, seasoning each layer with
butter, grated cheese, mustard, pepper, and salt; add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bread crumbs for the top layer. Cover and put it into
the oven, and bake with a moderate heat for a half
hour. Remove the cover, and when the top is
browned serve in the baking-dish.</p>

<p>Minced fat pork may be used instead of butter.</p>


<h4>Baked Turkey.</h4>

<p>Tame and wild turkeys are prepared and cooked
alike. The time for cooking is from fifteen to twenty
minutes to the pound, but this depends much upon
the age of the bird; it must be well done to be palatable.
Success lies in cooking it long enough, and
frequent basting.</p>

<p>Put the turkey into a pan of cold water; rinse it inside
and out in three or four waters; in the last water
but one dissolve a teaspoonful of soda. Fill the body
with this water; shake it well; pour it off and rinse
with fresh water; wipe it dry inside and out; rub the
inside with pepper and salt. Prepare a stuffing as follows;
Mix into enough grated bread crumbs to fill
the craw and body of the turkey a half teaspoonful of
summer savory, thyme, or sage, four ounces of lard,
four ounces of butter, with enough warm water to
make the mixture moist.</p>

<p>Mix all thoroughly and stuff the craw and body with
it; tie a string tightly about the neck; sew up the
incision; tie down the wings and legs; then lay it on
its back in the baking-pan; wet the skin and season
it with pepper and salt and dredge it with flour. Distribute
on the upper side small pieces of butter; put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
into the pan about a pint of boiling stock or a quarter
of a pound of butter; have a brisk fire; put the pan
into the oven and bake. Baste frequently, at least
every ten minutes; bake to a rich brown. If it browns
too rapidly lay a sheet of white paper over it until the
lower part is done. When the turkey is browned on
the breast turn it over in the pan while in the oven.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt, and dredge the back with flour, and
bake until browned, basting as above. When baked
remove the strings from the neck and body; put it
into a hot dish and serve with a flour gravy, made as
described on page 62.</p>

<p>The turkey may also be stuffed with sausage-meat,
fresh oysters or roasted chestnuts.</p>


<h4>Pie Crust.</h4>

<p>All pie crust should be made in a cool place and
handled as little as possible during the process. The
heat from the hand makes the crust tough. The ingredients
are:</p>

<p>One quart of flour (sifted); one-fourth of a pound
butter; one-half teaspoonful salt; enough cold water
to make a stiff dough. Sift the flour into a deep
wooden bowl or tin pan; put into it the salt; mix;
then the lard. With a keen chopping-knife cut up the
lard into the flour until it is thoroughly incorporated,
with no lumps; wet with cold water, stirring it in with
a wooden spoon until it becomes a stiff dough. Flour
the hands and make dough into a lump with as little
handling as possible.</p>

<p>Remove lump to well-floured kneading-board, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
roll it out into a sheet a fourth of an inch thick, always
rolling from you, and with as little pressure upon
the rolling-pin as may be necessary.</p>

<p>Into the rolled sheet stick small pieces of butter at
regular intervals. Dredge slightly with flour. Roll
up the sheet, commencing to roll from the side nearest
you. Roll out, again buttering and dredging until the
butter is exhausted. If time will permit, when the
butter has been exhausted and the roll made up, lay
it away in a cold place or on the ice for twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>Place it again upon the floured kneading-board, roll
out into a sheet as hereinbefore directed. Butter the
pie-plates; lay the paste lightly within them, fitting
it nicely. Trim off the paste neatly around the edges
of the pie-plates. Gather up the cuttings and roll
them into a separate sheet.</p>

<p>If the pies are to have a top crust, cover the tops
with the paste, cutting neatly round the edges, and
with a knife, spoon or the fingers join securely the
edges of the top and sides to prevent escape of juices.
Then with a sharp knife make three or four incisions
about an inch long in the center of the top crust.</p>

<p>If the top crust is lightly brushed with sweet milk,
it will brown evenly.</p>

<p>Bake in a moderate oven until a light brown. Be
careful to have the heat as great at the bottom as at
the top of oven. If this is not looked to, the lower
crust will be uncooked and inedible.</p>

<p>Should a richer crust be desired the proportions of
lard and butter can be doubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>


<h4>Brown Betty (Baked).</h4>

<p>The ingredients are: Cooking-apples, pared, cored,
and sliced; dry-bread crumbs, or well-toasted bread
rolled into crumbs; sugar, butter, and ground cinnamon.</p>

<p>Grease well a deep baking-dish. Into the bottom
of this put a layer of prepared apples; sprinkle them
lightly with sugar; scatter small pieces of butter over
this, then dust with ground cinnamon; over this place
a layer of bread crumbs from one-half to three-quarters
of an inch thick; over this apples, butter, and cinnamon,
and continue this process until the dish is full, or
until sufficient material has been used. The top layer
must be crumbs, and on this must be scattered small
pieces of butter. If the top layer is moistened with a
couple of tablespoonfuls of milk it will brown more
evenly.</p>

<p>Put into a moderate oven and bake from a half to
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>When a fork will easily penetrate the apples it is
cooked. Alden dried apples may be substituted for
the fresh fruit.</p>

<p>It can be eaten hot or cold with butter, sugar, or
sauce.</p>


<h4>Baked Apple Pudding.</h4>

<p>Use the following ingredients: Apples pared, cored
and sliced; one quart sifted flour; three teaspoonfuls
baking powder, incorporated with the dry flour;
one-half teaspoonful salt; two tablespoonfuls lard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
(half butter is preferable); one pint milk (cold water
will do).</p>

<p>Have ready sugar, butter, and ground cinnamon.
Put flour into a deep dish or pan; mix into it the salt
and lard; then add the milk, and work the mixture
with the hands to a smooth light dough.</p>

<p>Roll the dough into a sheet about one-quarter of an
inch thick. Have prepared a well-greased baking-dish.
Cover the bottom and sides of the dish with
rolled dough or paste, press it lightly against the
sides and bottom, and cutoff the edges above the dish.</p>

<p>Put into the bottom of the baking-dish thus prepared
a thick layer of sliced apples, sprinkle them
with sugar and ground cinnamon, then another layer
of apples treated in like manner, and so on successively
until the dish is full. The top layer of apples
should have the dressing of sugar and cinnamon, and
be also sprinkled with small pieces of butter. Wet
the top layer with three or four teaspoonfuls of water,
and then sprinkle it lightly with dry flour.</p>

<p>Take the remainder of the dough, roll it out thin,
and cover the dish with it, pressing the paste down
round the edges of the dish to join it with the paste
that lines the sides. Make three or four incisions in
the cover with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>Then put the dish into a moderate oven and bake
from one to one and a half hours. When a fork
easily penetrates the pudding, it is cooked. Eat hot
with sauce. Alden dried apples, canned apples,
canned peaches, or fresh peaches pared, quartered,
and the stones extracted may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>


<h4>Baked Apple Dumplings.</h4>

<p>The apples pared, cored and quartered. Prepare
paste as directed for Baked Apple Pudding above.</p>

<p>When the paste is rolled, cut it into squares, and in
the centre of each square place the four parts of an
apple; add to each apple a piece of butter the size of
a chestnut and a small sprinkle of sugar and ground
cinnamon.</p>

<p>Envelop the apple in the paste, pressing the cut
edges together. Place the dumplings thus prepared
into a well-greased baking-pan, cut edges downwards.</p>

<p>Bake a half to three-fourths of an hour in a moderate
oven. When a fork will penetrate the dumplings
they are cooked. Apples dried by the Alden process
may be used.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">HINTS.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cooking in Iron Pots.</span>&mdash;Let nothing stand in an
iron pot after it is cooked, or it will become discolored
and have an unpleasant taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty Knives.</span>&mdash;If knives become rusty, rub them
with a fresh-cut potato dipped in ashes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emetic.</span>&mdash;Gunpowder dissolved in water is a good
emetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Save the Bacon Grease.</span>&mdash;After frying salt pork,
bacon or fat meat, do not discard the grease that is
left in the pan. Keep a cup or small tin pail, in
which pour all residue. It will soon harden, and is
just the thing for frying slapjacks or potatoes in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improved River Water for Drinking.</span>&mdash;If you
make tea do not throw out the "grounds" after each
drawing. In warm weather ordinary lake or river
water will taste very refreshing if poured into the pot
where tea-grounds have been left, and allowed to
stand a few minutes before drinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salt.</span>&mdash;It is always best in cooking to use too little
salt rather than too much. Further salting can be
easily done at any time, but it is difficult or impossible
to freshen anything that has been over-salted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><span class="smcap">Baking Powder.</span>&mdash;In using baking powder it is
always best to follow the printed directions on the
can as to the amount. The different makes of baking
powders have each a different strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spoons.</span>&mdash;On a canoe trip, where storage room is at
a premium, one spoon will suffice for all purposes.
Let it be of iron, of "dessert" size. Get a tinsmith
to cut off two inches of the handle, and solder
strongly to the stump a tin cylinder one-half inch
in diameter. There will be no long handle to interfere
with packing it in a small space, and if a long handle
is desired for skimming soups, stirring mush, etc., a
stick of any length can be instantly cut to fit the tin
cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Fish</span> should be soaked in cold water to
thaw them before cooking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish-eating Ducks</span> may be made palatable by
parboiling them in water with an onion in it. After
parboiling them throw away the onion and lay the
ducks in cold water for half an hour, after which they
may be roasted, broiled, fried or stewed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soft vs. Hard Water.</span>&mdash;Beans, peas and other
vegetables are best boiled in soft water. Hard
water can be made soft (if its hardness depends upon
the presence of carbonate of lime) by boiling it an
hour and then allowing it to cool, when most of the
lime will be precipitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broiling.</span>&mdash;Remember that it is better to broil
before a fire than over it, as by the former process the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
juices of the meat can be caught and used as a dressing,
while in the latter manner they are lost in the fire
and tend to give a smoky flavor by their ignition. In
broiling, the article should be turned frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frying.</span>&mdash;The lard or fat used for frying should
always be very hot before the article to be cooked is
put in. If little jets of smoke issue from the top of
the fat it is hot enough. If the fat is insufficiently
hot, anything cooked in it will taste of the grease,
while the moment a substance is dropped into fat at a
great heat the exterior pores are closed, and no grease
penetrates it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mixing Ingredients.</span>&mdash;Preciseness in the preparation
of ingredients is an important element of success
in cooking. Guessing at proportions is the practice
of the lazy or indifferent cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Iron Pots.</span>&mdash;Boil a handful of grass in a
new iron pot, then scrub it inside with soap and sand,
fill it with clean water and let this boil half an hour.
It is then ready to use for cooking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Table of Approximate Weights and Measures.</span>&mdash;The
following table may be of use. It is near
enough to accuracy for cooking purposes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three teaspoonfuls = One tablespoonful.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls = One wine glass.</p>

<p>Two wine glasses = One gill.</p>

<p>Two gills = One tumbler or cup.</p>

<p>Two cupfuls = One pint.</p>

<p>One quart sifted flour = One pound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>One quart powdered sugar = One pound, seven
ounces.</p>

<p>One quart granulated sugar = One pound, nine
ounces.</p>

<p>One pint closely packed butter = One pound.</p>

<p>Three cupfuls sugar = One pound.</p>

<p>Five cupfuls sifted flour = One pound.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful salt = One ounce.</p>

<p>Seven tablespoonfuls granulated sugar = One half
pint.</p>

<p>Twelve tablespoonfuls flour = One pint.</p>

<p>Three coffee cupfuls = One quart.</p>

<p>Ten eggs = One pound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Yeast.</span>&mdash;A serviceable yeast for leavening bread
may be made by mixing flour and cold water into a
thin batter. Set it away in a bottle until it sours,
when it is ready for use.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
